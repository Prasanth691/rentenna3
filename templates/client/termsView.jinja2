            <h2>Tracking Technologies / Cookies</h2>
            <p>A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user’s computer for record-keeping purposes.  We use cookies on this site.  We do not link the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit while on our site</p>
            <p>We use both session ID cookies and/or persistent cookies.  We use session cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our site. A session ID cookie expires when you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser’s “help” file.</p>
            <p>We set a persistent cookie to enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our site.</p>
            <h3>Web Beacons / Gifs</h3>
            <p>We employ a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons), that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective.  Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users.  In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We do not tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers’ personally identifiable information.</p>
            <h3>Analytics / Log Files</h3>
            <p>As is true of most web sites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files.  This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data.</p>
            <p>We use this information to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track users’ movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.  We do not link this automatically-collected data to personally identifiable information.</p>
            <h3>3rd Party Tracking</h3>
            <p>The use of cookies by our affiliates and service providers is not covered by our privacy policy.  We do not have access or control over these cookies.  Our third party affiliates may also employ clear gifs images, and scripts that help them better manage their content on our site. We do not tie the information gathered to our Customers’ or Users’ personally identifiable information.</p>
            <h3>Behavioral Targeting / Re-Targeting</h3>
            <p>We may partner with third party ad networks to either display advertising on our Web site or to manage our advertising on other sites.  Our ad network partners may use cookies and Web beacons to collect non-personally identifiable information about your activities on this and other Web sites to provide you targeted advertising based upon your interests.</p>
            <p>We may use Google AdSense to publish ads on this site.  When you view or click on an ad a cookie will be set to help better provide advertisements that may be of interest to you on this and other Web sites.   You may opt-out of the use of this cookie by visiting Google’s Advertising and Privacy page: http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html</p>
            <h2>Security</h2>
            <p>The security of your personal information is important to us.  When you enter sensitive information (such as a credit card number) on our order forms, we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).</p>
            <p>We follow generally accepted standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it.  No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however.  Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. If you have any questions about security on our Web site, you can contact us at team@addressreport.com. </p>
            <h2>Terms of Service</h2>

            <p>You agree to indemnify and hold harmless AddressReport and its affiliates, and their respective members, directors, officers, managers, employees, shareholders, agents, and licensors, from and against all losses, expenses, damages and costs, including reasonable attorneys' fees, resulting from or relating to any use or misuse by you of our Services, including without limitation our email publications, email alerts, property reports, data, information, and/or website, or any violation by you of this policy and terms of service or any breach by you of your representations and warranties hereunder.  We reserve the right to take over the exclusive defense of any claim for which we are entitled to indemnification under this section. In such event, you shall provide us with such cooperation as is reasonably requested by us.</p>
            <h2>Governing Law and Jurisdiction</h2>
